Presentation
------------
Smoggle is a cross platform C++ program for playing music on traditional speakers. 
The main objective of Smoggle is to provide basic features for writing music scores 
and emulating them on a speaker. All scores are described in a simple XML file like 
the following:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<score tempo="150" name="My music score">
  <block loops="2">
    <block>
      <note value="C,4" />
      <note value="D,4" />
      <note value="E,4" />
      <note value="F,4" />
      <note value="G,4" />
      <note value="A,4" />
      <note value="B,4" />
    </block>
    <pause duration="3.0" />
    <block>
      <note value="B,5" />
      <note value="A,5" />
      <note value="G,5" />
      <note value="F,5" />
      <note value="E,5" />
      <note value="D,5" />
      <note value="C,5" />
    </block>
    <pause duration="3.0" />
  </block>
</score>

The syntax is relatively intuitive for beginners. This file format was almost chosen 
to ease the reading/writing of music scores for musicians and the sharing between 
users. However, adding support for other file formats is straightforward.Finally, 
many famous songs are provided with the software. Feel free to send me your wishlist 
for adding features ;)
